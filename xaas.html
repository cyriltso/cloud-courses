## IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS, Baremetal

---

# Notions to understand:

- Understanding migration cost.
- Understanding lock-in
- Understanding the trade-off between velocity/flexibility

---

# Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

## What does it mean?

- You get a compute instance with certain caracteristics (CPU, memory, I/O)
- You have a OS with your SSH key on it
- You can have storage and I/O added

## What are you paying for?

- Harware installation and maintenance, datacenter costs

## When does it make sense to do it?

- You want to have complete control of the code you run (finetune, ...)
- You want to migrate quickly to another cloud provider

## Typical examples:

- [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/)
- [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
- [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/product-categories/compute/)

# Platform as a Service (PaaS)

## What does it mean?

- Your development platform works out of the box.

## What are you paying for?

- OS maintained, provisionned, secured, ...
- Harware installation and maintenance, datacenter costs

## When does it make sense to do it?

- Small team that want to deliver a product quickly
- A bit more complex to migrate

## Typical examples:

- [clevercloud](https://clever-cloud.com)
- [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

# Software as a Service (SaaS)

## What does it mean?

- You have a service with strong added value delivered directly to you

## What are you paying for?

- Your service (usually per user/usage)
- OS maintained, provisionned, secured
- Harware installation and maintenance, datacenter costs

## When does it make sense to do it?

- You are ready to loose flexibility to increase velocity

## Typical examples

- [G suite](https://gsuite.google.fr/intl/fr/)
- [Slack](https://slack.com)
- [Github](https://github.com)

# Where does it make sense?

- You need to scale up/down very quickly (Media, On-demande business)

---

# Where does the cloud not make sense?

- Legacy systems based on proprietary hardware
- Real-time / Mission critical scenarios

---

# Practical exams:

- You got an app: Wordpress
- Comparison between make it work on PaaS platform/IaaS platform
