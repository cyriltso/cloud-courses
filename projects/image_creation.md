# Image creation subject

- Create a Image for a particular application
  - Using Packer, create an instant application for a specific application.
  - Your build should be:
      - documented (I understand what this image is for and how it is build),
      - reproductible (I can rebuild the image starting from the same image and get the same results)
      - testable (the image works and I can prove it by passing some tests)
