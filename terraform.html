# What problems does it solve?

- I need to know what will happen before I run something
  - `terraform plan`

- I need to have a way to reproduce my infrastructure
  - Declare resources in a terraform file
  - Version it with git

---

# How does it works?

1. You declare your infrastructure. (Desired state)
1. You run `terraform plan` to see what terraform will do without actually doing it
1. You run `terraform apply` to make it happen

---

# Provider

```
A provider in Terraform is responsible for the lifecycle of a resource:
  - create
  - read
  - update
  - delete
```

Each vendor is going to support its own provider

---

# Provisionner

Provisioners are used to execute scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation or destruction.

- [chef](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/chef.html)
- [salt](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/salt-masterless.html)
- [local-exec](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html)
- [remote-exec](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/remote-exec.html)

---

# Terraform state

- Where terraform store all the known state of your infrastructure.
- Used to gather what exists to compute the diff of what needs to happen to reach the desired state

Beware: Multiple users modifying it in the same time.

Beware: If you delete it, terraform will recreate all your resources.

# Import

Problem: I already got infrastructure that is defined.
How can I manage it with terraform?

`$ terraform import scaleway_server.foobar 7b8f6ad6-f26b-4ffa-8464-e27fe22d40d4`

```
resource "scaleway_server" "foobar" {
  name  = "foobar"
  image = "857de28c-39ce-4b15-9389-b68d8bb1bb51"
  type  = "VC1S"
}
```
